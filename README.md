# SquirrelAndChestnutsGame
Pygame
The Squirrel and Tigers game is programmed by using Python.
The game uses the Pygame library.
To play games, you can use a keyboard or computer mouse.
In the process of building the game there will be shortcomings.
Therefore, I look forward to receiving feedback and criticism from you. 
Thank you very much.
